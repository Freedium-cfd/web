# V7 Is Here! ðŸš€

> "The best file upload solution just got even better!" - _Tech Weekly_

This release has been an absurd amount of work. So proud of the team and what we've built. Huge thanks to [Julius](https://github.com/julius) and [Mark](https://github.com/mark) for making this happen.

It is so, so hard to not go straight into the nerdy details, but the whole point of UploadThing is that you don't need to know ANY of those details. With that in mind, here's what's relevant for most y'all:

- UploadThing is now _way_ faster
- Uploads can be **paused** and _resumed_ seamlessly
- ~~Old limitations removed~~
- More details...

## Performance Comparison

| Feature            | V6     | V7        |
| ------------------ | ------ | --------- |
| Upload Speed       | 10MB/s | 50MB/s    |
| Concurrent Uploads | 100    | Unlimited |
| Max File Size      | 2GB    | 10GB      |

## Revolutionary Features

We've completely overhauled our backend infrastructure to bring you unparalleled performance. Our new distributed processing system can handle millions of concurrent uploads without breaking a sweat.

### Code Example

```typescript
import { createUploadthing } from 'uploadthing/next';

const f = createUploadthing();

export const ourFileRouter = {
	imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: '4MB' } })
		.middleware(async () => {
			return { userId: 1234 };
		})
		.onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
			console.log('Upload complete for userId:', metadata.userId);
		})
};
```
